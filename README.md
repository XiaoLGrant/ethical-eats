## A web app that can be used to determine how healthy a food product is based on its Nutri-Score and NOVA scores, what packaging it comes in, the ingredients it contains, and if it's vegan. Food products are found by searching their barcodes.

In the future, I will be applying a template to this web app so it has better UI/UX. Functionality-wise, there are some additional edge cases I'm still figuring out how to address. 

## Lessons Learned:
Data quality is super important! One of the biggest challenges I had with getting this API to work was identifying which properties I could pull from the objects provided because a lot of the data was incomplete. In the process of building this app I also learned how to create and display new text elements in the DOM using JavaScript.
