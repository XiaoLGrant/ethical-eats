# Ethical Eats
A web app that can be used to determine how healthy a food product is based on its Nutri-Score and NOVA scores, what packaging it comes in, the ingredients it contains, and if it's vegan. Food products are searched by their barcode. Built using HTML, CSS, JS, and the Open Food Facts API.
